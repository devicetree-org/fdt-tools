Licensing and contribution policy of fdt-tools
==============================================

This fdt-tools package contains two pieces of software: the tools and
an addition to libfdt which comprises the files in the libfdt_extra/
directory. The libfdt additions are BSD-licensed so that they can be
built into an executable. The tools are GPL-licensed.

As SPDX license tags in each source file attest, the tools are licensed
under the GNU GPL v2 or later.  See gpl-2.0.txt for the licence.  The
tools may not be incorporated into works which do not have a
GPL-compatible license.

The libfdt addition, however, are GPL/BSD dual-licensed.  That is, they
may be used either under the terms of the GPL, or under the terms of
the 2-clause BSD license.  The full terms of that license can
be found in the file entitled 'bsd-2-clause.txt'. This is, in practice,
equivalent to being BSD-licensed, since the terms of the BSD license are
strictly more permissive than the GPL.

This approach to licensing has be chosen tofollow how the dtc project
works. Please see the license README there for more information.


Technical notes
===============

License headers in the source files use SPDX. See Linux Foundation's
SPDX project [1].

If a "SPDX-License-Identifier:" line references more than one Unique
License Identifier, then this means that the respective file can be
used under the terms of either of these licenses, i. e. with

	SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0+ OR BSD-2-Clause

you can choose between GPL-2.0+ and BSD-2-Clause licensing.

The SPDX Unique License Identifiers are used here, which are available
at [2].

Please ensure that each new file has an SPDX tag at the top.
